Fracture modeling plays an important role to understand the fluid flow in carbonate reservoirs. The existence of fractures highly modifies how fluid flow behaves in the reservoirs, thus highlighting the impact of a proper characterization of fracture parameters. The fracture characterization in terms of Discrete Fracture Networks (DFNs) can take advantage of the analogue outcrop studies. The outcrops, exposed rock formations that allow reservoir modeling with the same characteristics, are either explored through LiDAR and digital photogrammetry modeling creating Virtual Outcrop Models (VOMs). Fracture characterization in VOMs is usually carried considering its 2D attributes or its 3D attributes visualized through a flat-screen. However, even with 3D visualization, the identification of these attributes in the model is difficult due to the lack of depth perception. The use of an immersive Virtual Reality (iVR) system can mitigate these problems while increasing the understanding of the outcrop as viewed in the field, but used so far more for training and educational purposes. We propose in this work the use of iVR for stochastic DFN modeling and volumetric intensity mapping of a naturally fractured carbonate reservoir analogue, Jandaíra Formation, Potiguar Basin, NE Brazil. We compare our fracture model with 2D fracture models mapped in the same outcrop using an estimated correlation index between aerial and volumetric fracture intensity. Considering the results of the estimated models and standard deviations, our method obtained expected results for volumetric fracture intensity, compared to previous studies carried out in the same region from field and orthophoto data collection.
